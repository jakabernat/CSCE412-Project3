     <div class="text1"><h1>During the last few years, the concept of meeting new people has changed drastically. Because of the pandemic and introverted people dating is transitioning online. That is the biggest reason why I have decided to develop a dating app. However, because of the big competition, I had to be very creative. There are hundreds of dating apps out there, I need to give the customer a reason to download and use my application.</h1></div>

      <div class="text2"><h1>The main idea of dating apps is to land that first date. The truth is, that many people fear meeting strangers on the internet. First dates can be awkward and uncomfortable. I concluded that I need something to break the ice when two strangers decide to meet. My answer was dogs. Dogs are perfect for breaking the ice on a first date. Instead of going for dinner or a movie, the first date could be a walk in the park with your furry friend.</h1></div>
                
      <div class="text3"><h1>That’s the story of how “Paw” was born, a dating app for all dog owners. First dating app where dog owners can match and go on their “Doggy Date”. Because I knew that I don’t know to build this app on my own I decided to join Aggie Coding Club. In the fall semester of 2022, I started working as a project manager at Aggie Coding Club developing a cross-platform app using React.js.</h1></div>       
      
      <div class="text4"><h1>During this period I have learned a lot about application development as well as led 20 developers in the process. I have designed the layout and structure of the app. In addition, I have made implementation plans and hosted workshops and progress-tracking meetings.</h1></div>
      
      <div class="text5"><h1>We have been working in three teams: Profile Creation, Swiping Mechanism, and Chatbox. Profile creation has two parts, a dog profile, and a human profile. We implemented swiping mechanism, which is very similar to other dating apps. Now we are in the finishing phase of making an interactive chat box when users match.</h1></div>

      <div class="text6"><h2>Note: Application is still in development phase.</h2></div>
